Design decisions about the app:

1. I started making the list using cardviews and recyclerview, but thought it looked pretty sparse
   and since the guidelines say that > 3 lines of text warrants a cardview I opted for a simple list
2. For the rows themselves I used a viewflipper to switch from overview and detail
3. For the edit activity I allow the edit texts to be modifiable from the start of the activity, and
   if any of them are updated, all are passed back to the parent main activity.
4. This is targeted for API 23, with minimum API level 21 so I could try it out on my phone.
